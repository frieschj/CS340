Routes in the app.js file were modified to use the queries we created for our database, the routes and variables were updated to be used with our own database/webapp. The delete and update javascript files were adapted so that the variables reflect the attributes
from the database we created. The function names were changed to better reflect their usage with our database. The handlebars templates were updated so that the tables show the data from each of our entities that we created using MySQL. The forms on the handlebars
templates were updated so that they can be used to manipulate the data in our database.
