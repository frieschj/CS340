    and Cascade mountain ranges. Some of these even traverse slopes on active
    volcanoes. Alternatively, many other hiking trails can be found along the
    scenic Pacific coast or in the lush Hoh Rainforest. Not to be overlooked,
    eastern Washingtonâ€™s shrubsteppe ecosystem is also home to many trails.
